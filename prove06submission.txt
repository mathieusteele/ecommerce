After completing the assignment, be sure to push to Github and Heroku.
Please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application (e.g., Heroku):

https://serene-atoll-95168.herokuapp.com/menu

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):

https://github.com/mathieusteele/ecommerce

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 

Visitors can create an account, log in, CRUD menu items (update and delete only items they created!), add items to cart, complete an order, reset password. 

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.

The admin forms (add/edit menu items) only work with valid data. Instead of showing the user a helpful message and displaying the form, instead a 500 error shows. 

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.

I enjoyed seeing the restaurant website come together and I liked the self-service features of having users reset their own passwords and the data validation.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?

I would like to have taken it to the next step of setting up payment processing through a 3rd party payment processor integration.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

   5

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

I added a tool to increment/decrement the number of the item in the cart so consumers can easily edit the cart while in the cart (more than just removing the item completely.)
