After completing the assignment, be sure to push to Github and Heroku.
Please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application (e.g., Heroku):

    https://serene-atoll-95168.herokuapp.com/

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):

    https://github.com/mathieusteele/ecommerce

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 

    Users can view a list of books and add, edit, and delete books.

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.

    I am not aware of any assigned steps that are not working correctly.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.

    I was able to push myself to enable editing of books.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?

    I'm familiar with Heroku from using it before but I think the instructions may not have been as helpful for me if I didn't have experience with Heroku. It's the area I think students could get the most tripped up on this week.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

   I feel my assignment exceeded functional requirements.

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

    I feel this way because I selected a challenging stretch of being able to edit books.
